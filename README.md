Sleep Time Bedtime Calculator
===================

Sleep Time Bedtime Calculator is a Javascript/Node.js based bedtime calculator that helps you decide when to go to sleep. It works by counting backwards in 90-minute sleep cycles so that you wake up refreshed and alert (instead of tired and groggy).

The main website can be viewed at <http://sleep.seanfisher.co/>.
